## Vito's golden rule
 - Points are assigned according to the current Serie A rule
 - 3 points for a won match
 - 1 point for a tied match
 - 0 point for a lost match
 - BUT:
  + let A and B be two teams of a given match M
    let A be the winner:
      - Assign 3 points to A
      - if points(A) < points(B) **after** the Assignation then:
      Swap A position with B position
